A front-end demonstration of a list & note-taking webapp.

This project was done to fulfill the requirements of the January 2019 Code Louisville Front End Web Development course.

As it exists right now, it contains basic functionality within the current session. Users are able to create to-do items
consisting of a headline title and, optionally, a description with more details. The page also includes a calendar which,
when opened, enables users to click the date and have it inserted into the description field to facilitate due dates, etc. 
The list can be reordered and items can be checked off (with the title then being struck through) or removed completely. 
In addition there is a scratch-pad area for note-taking that, when the window is resized (or on smaller devices), moves to 
the bottom of the page.

Stretch goals include a persistent session and a mobile app.
